In 2024, Oracle posted $8.7B in ERP software revenue, edging past SAP’s $8.6B and ending SAP’s reign that began in the 1980s.\nSo, what’s driving Oracle’s surge?\nCloud-first strategy. Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP continues to win over industries like healthcare, banking, and construction — especially after the acquisition of Cerner. It’s agile, scalable, and built for a data-driven, AI-powered world.\nMeanwhile, SAP remains a heavyweight, particularly for large, complex, multinational operations. SAP S/4HANA is still the go-to for enterprises in manufacturing, supply chain, and finance that demand deep functionality and localization.\nIn-demand ERP skills right now?\n\n•\nOracle Cloud: Financials, HCM, SCM,                   EPM\n\n•\nSAP S/4HANA: Finance, Logistics,                       BTP, SuccessFactors\n\n•\nERP-integrated AI and automation                       specialists\n\n•\nCyber-secure ERP architects\n⸻\nAt Skyline IT, we specialise in sourcing niche SAP and Oracle ERP consultants with the technical depth, local language skills, and sector experience global programmes demand.

        "postContent": "Why the CIO Can’t Lead Your AI Strategy — And Why You Now Need a CAIO\nAI is not an IT upgrade.\nIt’s not “something the CIO can handle alone”.\nIt’s a fundamental shift in how businesses operate and it demands leadership far beyond systems and servers.\nThis is where the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) comes in.\n Not as a luxury,  but as an essential leadership function for any organisation serious about getting value from AI.\nWhat’s the issue?\nCIOs are under pressure to “own” AI because it sits on top of infrastructure. \nBut AI transformation isn’t about infrastructure. It’s about change management, culture, and capability.\nThe result?\nThe majority AI projects are stalling at pilot stage.\nTeams adopt tools in silos with no support.\nOrganisations end up with shadow AI, unclear ROI, and rising risk.\nAnd the real problem?\nNo one is leading the behavioural change required to make AI stick.\nWhy a CAIO is now business-critical\nA good CAIO is not an engineer-in-chief. They’re a translator between business value and AI opportunity - someone who can redesign workflows, build internal capability, and lead cultural adoption.\nHere’s what they focus on:\n  Change Management\n AI isn’t about plugging in tools. It’s about rethinking how work gets done and who does it. That requires clear delivery rhythms, process retirement plans, and visible wins.\n  Cultural Adoption\n Fear slows everything down. A CAIO works across teams to normalise AI use, provide reassurance, and create safe spaces to test, fail, and learn.\n  Training & Enablement\n Most staff haven’t been trained. Many are using AI without guardrails. A CAIO puts proper education in place from awareness to hands-on skill-building.\nThis isn’t about one role replacing another. It’s about right seat, right remit.\nStill not sure? Here's what we’re seeing in real businesses:\n1 in 4 SMEs in the UK & Ireland have GenAI live.\n75% of knowledge workers are using AI… but only 1% of firms say they’re mature.\nOver 50% of employees have had no formal training and are improvising their way through it.\nThat gap? That’s your CAIO’s job to close.\nWhat the CAIO should deliver in the first 100 days:\nPhase 1: Diagnose\n Map top 10 workflows, identify data gaps, define outcome metrics.\nPhase 2: Design\n Select 2–3 pilots with real commercial upside. Lock in training and comms.\nPhase 3: Deliver\n Launch MVPs. Track time saved, accuracy gained, or revenue unlocked.\nPhase 4: Decide\n Scale what works, shut down what doesn’t. No vanity projects.\nAI won’t deliver returns just because you bought a licence. It delivers when you change how people work.\nThat’s not the CIO’s job. It never was.\nIf you’re a business leader, and you want AI to scale with purpose, with safety, and with results it’s time to bring a CAIO to the table in the UK.\nIs your AI strategy currently owned? Or is it drifting?\nI can help...\n#AI #ChiefAIOfficer #BusinessTransformation #Leadership #UKSME #ChangeManagement #AIIntegration #FutureOfWork"

You’re here to move the value needle.\nIt’s not about uptime. It’s about upside.\nIt’s not about scale. It’s about impact at scale.\nIt’s not about tech strategy. It’s about business strategy, enabled by tech.\nIf you’re not already playing by these new rules, I would argue that you are holding the title - but not the seat.\nMy take on the new playbook?\n[1] Obsess Over Outcomes, Not Output\nShipping features is easy. Moving metrics is hard.\n - The modern CTO doesn’t focus about how many stories got closed this sprint\n - They focus on what changed for the business - and how tech made that possible\n - They ask: Did we move revenue? Reduce churn? Open a new market?\n[2] Drive Commercial Impact, Not Just Code Quality\nClean code that doesn’t drive value is just elegant waste.\n - The best engineers think in loops and syntax. The best CTOs think in leverage.\n - Every tech decision should have a commercial consequence.\n - If your engineering team doesn’t understand how the company makes money, that’s on you.\n[3] See AI as a Business Tool, Not Just an Engineering Trick\nLLMs aren’t toys. They’re leverage.\n - Process automation, enhanced decision-making, customer experience - this is where AI earns its keep.\n - The CTO’s job is to connect AI to ROI, not just run proof-of-concepts that can gather dust.\n[4] Design Business Models, Not Just Systems\nThis is the \\\"\"final boss\\\"\" level.\n - The real differentiators won’t be in your backend - they’ll be in your business model.\n - Usage-based pricing, data monetisation, embedded finance - this is your domain now.\n - Your job is no longer to keep the lights on. It’s to invent new rooms.\nWe used to say the CTO was the most technical person in the room. Not anymore.\nNow you’re expected to be a translator, a strategist, and a growth enabler.\nYou don’t need to know every line of code - but you’d better understand every lever of value.\nCTOs who obsess over architecture are at risk of being replaced by those who obsess over value.\nIf your conversations are still about:\n - Systems instead of outcomes\n - Platforms instead of profit\n - Features instead of flow\nThen it's time to lean into the new playbook."

        "postContent": "There is a greater than an 80% probability that we aren’t too far off from a world where Forrester isn’t even in the top 10 analyst firms. (See what I did there #ar peeps, IYKTYK). In my humble opinion, it is a red flag when we get to the other side of one of the most transformative and profitable moments in recent IT history and a firm, whose job is to cover technology and biz buyers, can’t successfully ride that wave. “But #AI” you say…successful AI is largely built on cloud computing, with unique and notable exceptions.\nEnough delay, let’s break some eggs.\nFirst off, I have no problem with Forrester. I’ve worked with them for about 20 years and have probably spent more on the firm than all but a handful of people on earth…and probably not as much as I could/should have over that time. When I started working at AWS, Forrester was one of the few firms I entertained. Some of the best people and greatest analysts I’ve ever worked with came from Forrester. Many of the “newer” firms come from Forrester lineage, which is its own interesting topic.\nCloud computing represented one of the largest growth opportunities for the IT analyst firms in recent memory. Over the last decade, customers increased their spending on cloud by 635% to $752B with a CAGR of 16.5% set to push the category to $2.3T by 2032.\nMeanwhile…\nForrester. Forrester managed to improve revenues by $126M from 2014 to 2022. Specifically, Forrester’s revenue grew from approximately $312 million to a peak of $538 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 7%. The company faced revenue declines in 2023 and 2024, with revenues dropping to $481 million and $432 million, respectively. Translation, 5% decrease in contract value after 80+% moved to their new platform is trending to give back that growth and then some. So, basically Forrester did nada with their business revenues.\nGartner. Gartner managed to improve revenues by $4.25B over this same timeframe. Specifically, in 2014, Gartner’s revenue was approximately $2.02 billion. By 2024, revenue had grown to $6.27 billion, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 11.7%. Net income increased from $184 million in 2014 to $1.254 billion in 2024, marking a CAGR of approximately 19.4%. \nThe next question is pretty obvious, but I don’t want to call anyone out by name. Setting aside any banter on specific CEOs or their board members, or leadership - let’s look at the #AR community. If people pay for influence/awareness/deal validation and your leaders think AR is pay to play, then your actions/investments are clearly stating Forrester isn’t in the game and hasn’t been for a LONG time. The last time I can remember having a work day ruined because of Forrester is before the 2020s rolled around.\nRegardless of your goals, there is a real possibility we aren’t too far off from a world where Forrester isn’t even in the top 10 analyst firms (unless something drastic changes).\nBut…your bathrooms are cleaner."

But these optimizations have created a fundamental weakness in our organizational structures that's becoming painfully apparent today. \nThink of an organization as a living being. To function effectively, it needs three integrated systems: neural pathways to detect and transmit information, a brain to make decisions, and muscles to execute coordinated action. \nThe problem? Organizations today are being bombarded with unprecedented stimuli: tariffs, geopolitical tensions, AI disruption, increasing uncertainty and accelerating technological change. \nHowever, our obsession with efficiency has dulled our organizational senses. Democratized decision-making has created multiple competing brains, and our muscles are now receiving conflicting signals, leading to paralysis when decisive action is needed most.\nThe most alarming reality I'm witnessing is threefold:\n  Many companies can't sense changes... ostrichification of organizations if you will\n  Those that do struggle with fragmented decision-making.\n  Even with clear decisions, execution is hindered by fragmented structures each playing to conflicting and self serving purposes\nThe disruption is already here. The organizations that survive won't be those with the most efficient processes, but those with the most responsive nervous systems.\nIn the coming weeks, I'll explore how AI is exposing organizational weaknesses and the radical changes needed to thrive.

Agentic AI doesn’t start with technology, it starts with understanding the business. That means breaking down real-world processes into clear tasks that can be automated, orchestrated, and governed by Agents.\n𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐦: Pfft, shut up Stuart, that sounds like boring grunt work, we’ve seen the demos, just give us Agents.\nI said this three months ago:\n“We have to start with the business, and more specifically for Agents, the processes of the business. The boring moral of the story is start with the business, understand your processes, and get your data in order. These are the hard parts, the grunt work, the reality on the ground, that nobody seems to want to talk about. But if you do it, when the technology is ready, you will be first out of the gate to utilise it, and outpace your market.”\nI love being vindicated and Pradeep Sanyal just posted a new Capgemini report and guess what? Yep. Start with business and processes.\nThis is NOT the traditional top-down model onto the business as we’re used to with traditional IT practices, you start from actual business activities, creating digital definitions of how those processes are done, mapping these to Agents with highly-defined goals, roles, and boundaries.\nYou could start like his:\n- Mapping real operational processes\n- Identifying automation candidates\n- Designing Agent workflows\n- Optimising data and guardrails\n- Then deploy and scale Agents.\n- All done in tandem with multidisciplinary humans\nThere’s lots in this report around structured processes, importance of good data, clear guardrails, strong governance, human-AI collaboration by design, and they were honest enough to note Agentic systems are not trivial as they introduce distributed decision-making, emergent behavior, and unpredictability that traditional IT systems don’t.\nMuch of the stuff I’ve been talking about, so I won’t rehash it all here, you get the point.\nIf we start with technology, we get more technology, if we start with the business and customers, we get more…\nI’ll leave you with a quote from the document:\n“Leaping into agentic AI immediately without first evaluating simpler automation options is akin to creating a solution in search of a problem”.\nAmen.
